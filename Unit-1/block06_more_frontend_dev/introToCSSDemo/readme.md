*** Notes for introToCSSDemo ***

We will be using the same code that we started with in the previous lecture and we will now be adding CSS to style it. 

Start the demo by asking students to explain different tags, this can be used as a review from the previous lecture. 

Next create the css file via the CLI and then show the students how to add the <link> tag to connect the css and html files. 

Now you can use this code as a basis for demoing CSS to the students
