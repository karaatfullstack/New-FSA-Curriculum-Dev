*** Notes for JS Fundamentals ***

Start by using the CLI to create a new folder with an index.html and a main.js in it.  Next create the basic layout for the HTML page without a script tag linking the js file.  Add an H1 tag to this file. 

Now add a console.log to the JS file and open up the index.html with live server. 

Show the students that we can see that the server is up because we can see our H1 tag.  Open up the dev tools and show the students that we are not seeing our console.log.  

Now go back to our index.html file and add the script tag.  Take a moment to talk about where we place this tag and when we would want to add 'defer' to our tag. 

Return to the browser and show the students that we can now see our console.log.
