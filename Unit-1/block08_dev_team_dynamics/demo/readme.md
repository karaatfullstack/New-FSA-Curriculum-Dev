*** Notes for Pair Programming Demo ***

The instructor and another member of the instructional team should create this project as part of a pair programming group.  They should also make a note to switch driver/navigator midway during the demo. 

This will also serve as a review for setting up a a GitHub repo, for adding collaborators to a project, for cloning and for pushing to a repo.
