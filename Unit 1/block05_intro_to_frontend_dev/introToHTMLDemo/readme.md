*** Notes for introToHTMLDemo ***

You can use this code as a basis for demoing the basic HTML tags and functions.  

If possible, it is a good idea to have this demo open on one screen while you are live coding on another screen which is being shared with the students.  

Then you can systematically build this repo for the students while explaining the differences between the tags and some reasons for using each. You can introduce MDN documentation during the lecture by navigating to the MDN documentation as you introduce new tags.  This should also help make using documentation a norm for the students. 

Be sure to emphasize that there are many more tags than the ones that we are using during this demo.  Encourage them to look at the HTML documentation on MDN for additional information on the tags.
