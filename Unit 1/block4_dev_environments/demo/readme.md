*** Lesson Review ***
Start this lesson by walking the students through making a new folder titled 'gitPractice' inside of their course work folder.  This should be accomplished with CLI tools. 

Remember to check in frequently with the students to see if everyone is on the same page.  If one student ends up very far behind, you can have a mentor jump into a breakout room with them to debug the issue.  

Once the folder is created have the students open the 'gitPractice' with the 'code .' command.  Check with the students to ensure that everyone is able to use this command.  If there are students that are still having issues you can open up one or two breakout rooms, one for windows and one for mac, and debug this issue before moving forwards.  Or you can delegate it to office hours. 

The above demo should act as a good review from the previous CLI lectures. 


*** Now move on to working on the slides. Once you get to the GitHub demo section you can use the following instructions: *** 

Navigate to your GitHub account and walk the students through the basic layout of the website.  Next show them how to create a repo.  You can title this 'gitPracticeRepo'.  Once the repo is created, but it is empty you can return to the lecture slides where you will discuss setting up an SSH. 

Depending on the size of your class you can divide them into 2 or 4 groups, half of the groups are mac and half are windows.  Then split up your instructional staff among the groups and proceed to walk the smaller groups through setting up SSH.  

*** Once SSH is setup for all of the students you can show them how to connect the github repo to their local repo that we created earlier ***

Gather all of the students together and demo how to use the instructions that were provided to us when we created our 'gitPracticeRepo' to connect it to our local 'gitPractice' project and to push this information up to GitHub. 

Next demo how to add collaborators to a project by adding your co-instructor or mentor to the 'gitPracticeRepo'.  Then have that individual share their screen while they demo how to clone down the repo.  You can be narrating this process or the other person can. This will depend on the dynamics of your cohort. 


*** At the end of the lesson ask for questions and check again that all of the students have SSH working ***
