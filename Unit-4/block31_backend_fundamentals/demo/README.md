# Block 31: Backend Fundamentals Demo

## Overview

In this demo, we will be building a RESTful API with Express. We will be using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to build our API. We will also be using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test our API.

Begin by cloning this repo, then run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then `npm start` to start the server. Your server should be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## GET with Express

In this section, we will be building a GET route with Express. We will be using the `GET` method to retrieve data from our server.
