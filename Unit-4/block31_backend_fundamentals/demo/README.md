# Block 31: Backend Fundamentals Demo

## Overview

In this demo, we will be building a RESTful API with Express. 

First, demonstrate a GET request without Express.js. Coding sample found in the `index.js` file.

Then, demonstrate a GET request with Express.js. Coding sample found in the `server.js` file.

We will be using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to build our API. 

In the future, we will be using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test our API, but all of today's examples can be done in the browser. 

Begin by cloning this repo, then run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then `npm start` to start the server. Your server should be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
