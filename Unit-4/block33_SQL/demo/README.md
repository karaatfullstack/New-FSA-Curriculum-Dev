## What is SQL?

SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

## What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of data. It is the place where you store all your data so that you can easily access it later. A database is usually stored on a computer so that many people can access it at the same time.

## What is a database management system?

A database management system (DBMS) is a software package that allows you to store, organize, and retrieve data in a database. The DBMS provides many useful functions that do not come with a regular file system. The DBMS also prevents unauthorized access to the database.

## What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

## What is a table?

A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows. A table is similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

## What is a column?

A column is a vertical group of cells in a table. Each column stores data of a specific type, such as a number, a date, or a character string. A column has a name and a data type.

## What is a row?

A row is a horizontal group of cells in a table. Each row represents a single entity, such as a person, a place, or a thing. A row has a unique ID called the key.

## What is a primary key?

A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) whose value uniquely identifies each row in a table. A primary key must contain unique values, and cannot contain NULL values.

## What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column (or a combination of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table.

## What is a database schema?

A database schema is a blueprint or documentation of the logical structure of a complete database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. A database schema is a collection of database objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, indexes, and so on.
